# Monthly Dealer Strategy — Comprehensive Market Intelligence Report

A strategic monthly analysis that gives a dealer group the complete picture: how their brands are performing in the market, which models are depreciating fastest, what the broader market trends look like, and a full inventory intelligence report. Run this on the first Monday of each month.

**Architecture:** This skill uses up to 3 parallel sub-agents to generate the 5-section report. Brand analytics, market demand, and lot composition run simultaneously.

**Note: This skill is primarily US-focused.** Most sections require `get_sold_summary` which is US-only. UK locations will receive a supply-side market overview only.

## Dealer Group Profile (Load First)

1. Read `~/.claude/marketcheck/dealership-group-profile.json`.
2. If the file **does not exist**: Tell the user: "No dealer group profile found. Run `/onboarding` to set up your group context once." Then stop.
3. If the file **exists**, determine which location to use:
   - Ask: "Run monthly strategy for which location? Or 'all' for group rollup?"
   - Specific location: use that location's context
   - 'All': run per-location, then append GROUP MONTHLY ROLLUP
   - Extract all fields from the selected location:
     - `dealer_id`, `dealer_name` (name), `dealer_type`, `franchise_brands`
     - `zip`, `state`
   - Extract from profile:
     - `country` ← `location.country`
     - `radius`, `target_margin`, `recon_cost`, `floor_plan_per_day`, `max_dom`, `aging_threshold` from `preferences`
4. **Tool routing by country:**
   - **US**: All agents available
   - **UK**: Only `lot-scanner` agent works. Skip `brand-market-analyst` and `market-demand-agent`. Only Section 5 (supply-side overview) is available. Tell UK dealers: "The monthly strategy report relies on US sold transaction data for market share, depreciation, and trend analysis. For UK dealers, a competitive inventory scan is available."
5. Calculate date ranges:
   - `current_month`: first day to last day of the most recent complete month
   - `prior_month`: the month before that
   - `three_months_ago`: 3 months before current_month
6. Confirm: "Running monthly strategy report for **[dealer_name]**..."

## Execution: Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Wave 1 — Launch Simultaneously (US)

Launch these three agents **in parallel** using the Agent tool. All are independent.

**Agent A: `lot-scanner` (facets-only mode)**

Use the Agent tool to spawn the `dealership-group:lot-scanner` agent with this prompt:

> Pull lot composition for dealer_id=[dealer_id], country=US, mode=facets_only. Use rows=0 with facets=make|0|10|1,model|0|20|1 and stats=price,dom. Return the top 5 make/model combinations by count and overall lot statistics.

**Agent B: `market-demand-agent`**

Use the Agent tool to spawn the `dealership-group:market-demand-agent` agent with this prompt:

> Generate full inventory intelligence for state=[state], dealer_type=[dealer_type], zip=[zip], radius=[radius], target_margin_pct=[target_margin], recon_cost=[recon_cost]. Date range: [current_month date_from] to [current_month date_to]. Run sections: ds_ratios, turn_rates. Also include body type breakdown.

**Agent C: `brand-market-analyst`**

Use the Agent tool to spawn the `dealership-group:brand-market-analyst` agent with this prompt:

> Analyze brand performance and market trends for state=[state], dealer_type=[dealer_type], franchise_brands=[brands list]. Current month: [current_month dates]. Prior month: [prior_month dates]. Three months ago: [three_months_ago dates]. Run sections: brand_share, market_trends. Skip depreciation (will provide lot models in Wave 2).

### Wave 2 — After Lot Scanner Completes

Once `lot-scanner` returns the top 5 make/model combos from the location's lot:

**Run depreciation watch directly** (or spawn brand-market-analyst again):

For each of the top 5 models, call `mcp__marketcheck__get_sold_summary` with:
- `make`, `model`: the model
- `state`: from selected location
- `inventory_type`: `Used`
- `ranking_dimensions`: `make,model`
- `ranking_measure`: `average_sale_price`
- `top_n`: `1`
- Two calls per model: current_month dates AND three_months_ago dates

Calculate:
- Price Change $ = current avg_sale_price - baseline avg_sale_price
- Monthly Depreciation Rate % = (Price Change / baseline) / 3 x 100
- Flag models with monthly depreciation > 1.5% as **ACCELERATING DEPRECIATION**

### Wave 3 — Supply-Side Overview (US + UK)

This simple single call can run after Wave 1 completes or in parallel with Wave 2.

**US:** Call `mcp__marketcheck__search_active_cars`
**UK:** Call `mcp__marketcheck__search_uk_active_cars`

With:
- `zip`/`postcode`: from selected location
- `radius`: from preferences
- `car_type`: `used`
- `facets`: `make|0|20|1,body_type|0|10|1`
- `stats`: `price,dom`
- `rows`: `0`

### UK Execution Path

For UK locations, only run:
1. Wave 3 (Supply-Side Overview) using `search_uk_active_cars`
2. Note: "Sections 1-4 require US sold data and are not available for UK locations."

### Assembly — Combine All Results

1. **Section 1 (Brand Performance)** — from `brand-market-analyst` agent output
2. **Section 2 (Depreciation Watch)** — from Wave 2 depreciation calculations + lot-scanner facets
3. **Section 3 (Market Trends)** — from `brand-market-analyst` agent output
4. **Section 4 (Inventory Intelligence)** — from `market-demand-agent` agent output
5. **Section 5 (Supply-Side Overview)** — from Wave 3
