> **Date anchor:** Today's date comes from the `# currentDate` system context. Compute ALL relative dates from it. Example: if today = 2026-03-14, then "prior month" = 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-28, "current month" (most recent complete) = February 2026, "three months ago" = December 2025. Never use training-data dates.

# Depreciation Tracker — Vehicle Value Retention & Depreciation Intelligence

## Appraiser Profile (Load First — Optional Context)

Load the `marketcheck-profile.md` project memory file if exists. Extract: state, specialization, country, min_comp_count. If missing, ask — skill works without profile. US-only (`get_sold_summary`, `search_active_cars`); UK not supported. Confirm profile.

## User Context

User is an appraiser needing trend-adjusted valuations that account for recent depreciation velocity rather than stale book values.

| Required | Field | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Yes | Make/Model or segment | Ask |
| Recommended | Model year(s) | Ask |
| Auto/Ask | Geography (state/zip) | Profile or ask |
| Optional | Inventory type, comparison dimension, time horizon | Ask |

Clarify: used vehicle depreciation vs new vehicle MSRP parity — different workflows.

## Workflow: Make/Model Depreciation Curve

Use this when a user asks "how fast is the RAV4 losing value" or "show me the depreciation curve for a 2022 Civic." This is essential for trend-adjusted appraisals.

1. **Get current period sold data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `make`, `model`, `inventory_type=Used`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month). Include `state` if specified.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

2. **Get historical sold data at multiple intervals** — Make separate calls to `get_sold_summary` for each lookback period:
   - **60 days ago**
   - **90 days ago**
   - **6 months ago**
   - **1 year ago**
   Record `average_sale_price` at each point. Adjust dates based on today's date.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count per interval. Discard full response.

3. **Get current active market asking price** — Call `search_active_cars` with `year`, `make`, `model`, `car_type=used`, `stats=price`, `rows=0`. Include `zip`/`state` if available.
   → **Extract only**: mean, median, min, max price stats. Discard full response.

4. **Get original MSRP baseline** — Call `search_active_cars` with same YMMT, `rows=1`, `sort_by=price`, `sort_order=desc`. Decode the VIN for MSRP. Fallback: highest 1-year-ago sold price.
   → **Extract only**: msrp from decode. Discard full response.

5. **Build the depreciation curve** — Calculate at each time interval:
   - **Retention %** = (average_sale_price at interval / original MSRP) x 100
   - **Monthly depreciation rate** = (price change between consecutive intervals) / (months between intervals)
   - **Annualized depreciation rate** = monthly rate x 12
   Present as a table and describe the curve shape (linear, accelerating, stabilizing). For appraisers, note how the current depreciation velocity should adjust a book-value-based estimate.

## Workflow: Segment Value Trends

Use this when a user asks "are SUVs holding value better than sedans" or "how is EV depreciation compared to ICE."

1. **Get current period segment data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=body_type`, `ranking_measure=average_sale_price`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=10`.
   → **Extract only**: per body_type — average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period segment data** — Same call with dates shifted back 3 months (or user's chosen comparison window).
   → **Extract only**: per body_type — average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

3. **Get fuel type comparison** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `fuel_type_category=EV`, current period dates, `inventory_type=Used`. Repeat with `fuel_type_category=ICE`. Repeat both for prior period.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count per fuel_type per period. Discard full response.

4. **Calculate segment trends** — For each body type and fuel type:
   - **Period-over-period price change** = (current avg price - prior avg price) / prior avg price x 100
   - **Volume change** = (current sold_count - prior sold_count) / prior sold_count x 100
   - Flag segments where price declined more than 3% as "accelerating depreciation"
   - Flag segments where price held within +/- 1% as "stable"
   - Flag segments where price increased as "appreciating" (rare but happens with supply constraints)

5. **Deliver the segment comparison** — Present a ranked table from strongest retention to weakest. Highlight the EV vs ICE gap specifically. Include volume context. For appraisers, note which segments require trend adjustments to current valuations.

## Workflow: Brand Residual Ranking

Use this when a user asks "which brands hold value best" or "rank the automakers by residual value."

1. **Get current period brand prices** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=make`, `ranking_measure=average_sale_price`, `ranking_order=desc`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=25`.
   → **Extract only**: per make — average_sale_price. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period brand prices** — Same call with dates shifted back 6 months (or user's preferred comparison window).
   → **Extract only**: per make — average_sale_price. Discard full response.

3. **Get volume context** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=make`, `ranking_measure=sold_count`, `ranking_order=desc`, current period dates, `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=25`.
   → **Extract only**: per make — sold_count. Discard full response.

4. **Calculate brand retention scores** — For each make:
   - **Retention %** = current average_sale_price / prior average_sale_price x 100
   - **Volume trend** = current sold_count vs prior sold_count (indicates demand strength)
   - Rank brands by retention % descending
   - Separate into tiers: Tier 1 (>98% retention), Tier 2 (95-98%), Tier 3 (90-95%), Tier 4 (<90%)

5. **Present the brand ranking** — Show a ranked table with: Rank, Make, Current Avg Price, Prior Avg Price, Retention %, Volume, Tier. Highlight notable movers. For appraisers, brands in lower tiers may warrant additional depreciation adjustments in current valuations.

## Workflow: Geographic Depreciation Variance

Use this when a user asks "where do Tacomas hold value best" or "which states have the highest used car prices."

1. **Get state-level transaction data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `make`, `model`, `summary_by=state`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `inventory_type=Used`, `limit=5000`.
   → **Extract only**: per state — average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

2. **Get national baseline** — Same call without `summary_by` for national average.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

3. **Calculate geographic variance** — For each state:
   - **Price index** = state average_sale_price / national average_sale_price x 100 (100 = national average)
   - **Premium/discount** = state price - national price in dollars
   - Sort by price index descending to show where vehicles command the highest premiums

4. **Identify patterns** — Group states into:
   - **Premium markets** (index > 105): vehicles retain more value, typically lower supply or higher demand
   - **At-national-average** (index 95-105): mainstream pricing
   - **Discount markets** (index < 95): vehicles depreciate faster, often oversupplied or lower demand
   Note regional patterns (e.g., trucks command premiums in mountain/rural states, EVs hold better in CA/Northeast). For appraisers, the geographic index is critical for multi-state fleet valuations or insurance claims in different markets.

5. **Deliver the geographic map** — Present as a ranked table: State, Avg Transaction Price, National Avg, Price Index, Premium/Discount $, Sold Count. Highlight the top 5 and bottom 5 states for the specific vehicle.

## Workflow: MSRP Parity Tracker

Use this when a user asks "which new cars are selling over sticker" or "are markups coming down" or "incentive effectiveness."

1. **Get current MSRP parity data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `inventory_type=New`, `ranking_dimensions=make,model`, `ranking_measure=price_over_msrp_percentage`, `ranking_order=desc`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `top_n=30`.
   → **Extract only**: per make/model — price_over_msrp_percentage. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period parity data** — Same call with dates shifted back 3 months.
   → **Extract only**: per make/model — price_over_msrp_percentage. Discard full response.

3. **Get volume context** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `inventory_type=New`, `ranking_dimensions=make,model`, `ranking_measure=sold_count`, `ranking_order=desc`, current period dates, `top_n=30`.
   → **Extract only**: per make/model — sold_count. Discard full response.

4. **Classify parity status** — For each make/model:
   - **Above MSRP** (price_over_msrp_percentage > 0): dealer markups or strong demand
   - **At MSRP** (price_over_msrp_percentage between -1% and 0%): balanced market
   - **Below MSRP** (price_over_msrp_percentage < -1%): incentives/discounts active
   - **Trend direction**: compare current vs prior period to show if markups are growing or shrinking

5. **Present the parity report** — Show a table: Make/Model, Current % Over/Under MSRP, Prior Period %, Change Direction, Sold Volume. Highlight:
   - Models that flipped from above-MSRP to below (incentive programs taking effect)
   - Models still commanding premiums (constrained supply or high demand)
   - Models with deepening discounts (potential oversupply or model-year transition)

## Output

Present: depreciation headline with retention % and monthly rate, trend data table (period/price/retention/rate/volume), key signals (acceleration, volume shifts, geographic anomalies), and actionable appraisal adjustment recommendation with quantified impact.
