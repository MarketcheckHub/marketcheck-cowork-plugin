> **Date anchor:** Today's date comes from the `# currentDate` system context. Compute ALL relative dates from it. Example: if today = 2026-03-14, then "prior month" = 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-28, "current month" (most recent complete) = February 2026, "three months ago" = December 2025. Never use training-data dates.

# Depreciation Tracker — Residual Value Signals for OEM & Lending Stocks

## User Profile (Load First)

Load the `marketcheck-profile.md` project memory file if exists. Extract: `tracked_tickers`, `tracked_makes`, `tracked_states`, `benchmark_period_months`, `focus`, `country`. If missing, ask for make/model/segment focus. US-only. Confirm profile.

## User Context

Financial analyst evaluating residual value trends as investment signals for OEM stocks (pricing power, incentive spend), auto lending/leasing stocks (collateral erosion, residual exposure), and dealer group stocks (used car margins, inventory valuation). Every metric includes BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL/CAUTION signal tied to specific tickers.

## Workflow: Make/Model Depreciation Curve (Investment Signal)

Use this when a user asks "how fast is the RAV4 losing value" or "depreciation signal for Ford trucks."

1. **Get current period sold data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `make`, `model`, `inventory_type=Used`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month). Include `state` if specified.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

2. **Get historical sold data at multiple intervals** — Make separate calls to `get_sold_summary` for each lookback period:
   - **60 days ago**
   - **90 days ago**
   - **6 months ago**
   - **1 year ago**
   Record `average_sale_price` at each point. Adjust dates based on today's date.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price per interval. Discard full response.

3. **Get current active market asking price** — Call `search_active_cars` with `year`, `make`, `model`, `car_type=used`, `stats=price`, `rows=0`. Include `zip`/`state` if available.
   → **Extract only**: mean, median, min, max price stats. Discard full response.

4. **Get original MSRP baseline** — Call `search_active_cars` with same YMMT, `rows=1`, `sort_by=price`, `sort_order=desc`. Decode the VIN for MSRP. Fallback: highest 1-year-ago sold price.
   → **Extract only**: msrp from decode. Discard full response.

5. **Build the depreciation curve with investment signal** — Calculate at each time interval:
   - **Retention %** = (average_sale_price at interval / original MSRP) × 100
   - **Monthly depreciation rate** = (price change between consecutive intervals) / (months between intervals)
   - **Annualized depreciation rate** = monthly rate × 12
   - **Signal:**
     - **BEARISH** for OEM ticker: Monthly rate > 1.5% — "Accelerating depreciation suggests residual erosion; OEM may need production cuts or increased incentive spend"
     - **CAUTION**: Monthly rate 0.8-1.5% — "Moderate depreciation; watch for acceleration"
     - **NEUTRAL**: Monthly rate 0.3-0.8% — "Normal depreciation within historical range"
     - **BULLISH** for OEM ticker: Monthly rate < 0.3% or appreciating — "Strong residual retention signals pricing power and brand desirability"

## Workflow: Segment Value Trends (Sector Signal)

Use this when a user asks "are SUVs holding value better than sedans" or "EV depreciation vs ICE — investment implications."

1. **Get current period segment data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=body_type`, `ranking_measure=average_sale_price`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=10`.
   → **Extract only**: per body_type — average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period segment data** — Same call with dates shifted back 3 months (or user's chosen comparison window).
   → **Extract only**: per body_type — average_sale_price, sold_count. Discard full response.

3. **Get fuel type comparison** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `fuel_type_category=EV`, current period dates, `inventory_type=Used`. Repeat with `fuel_type_category=ICE`. Repeat both for prior period.
   → **Extract only**: average_sale_price, sold_count per fuel_type per period. Discard full response.

4. **Calculate segment trends with investment signals** — For each body type and fuel type:
   - **Period-over-period price change** with signal
   - **Volume change** with demand signal
   - Flag segments where price declined more than 3% as "ACCELERATING DEPRECIATION — BEARISH for OEMs heavy in this segment"
   - Map each segment to most-exposed tickers (e.g., Pickup depreciation → F, GM; EV depreciation → TSLA, RIVN, LCID)

5. **Deliver the segment comparison** — Present a ranked table from strongest retention to weakest. Highlight the EV vs ICE gap specifically with lending stock implications.

## Workflow: Brand Residual Ranking (OEM Stock Signal)

Use this when a user asks "which brands hold value best" or "rank OEMs by residual strength."

1. **Get current period brand prices** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=make`, `ranking_measure=average_sale_price`, `ranking_order=desc`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=25`.
   → **Extract only**: per make — average_sale_price. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period brand prices** — Same call with dates shifted back 6 months.
   → **Extract only**: per make — average_sale_price. Discard full response.

3. **Get volume context** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `ranking_dimensions=make`, `ranking_measure=sold_count`, `ranking_order=desc`, current period dates, `inventory_type=Used`, `top_n=25`.
   → **Extract only**: per make — sold_count. Discard full response.

4. **Calculate brand retention scores with ticker mapping** — For each make:
   - **Retention %** = current average_sale_price / prior average_sale_price × 100
   - Map to ticker
   - Rank by retention % descending
   - Tier classification:
     - Tier 1 (>98% retention) — BULLISH: Strong residual retention = pricing power
     - Tier 2 (95-98%) — NEUTRAL: Normal depreciation
     - Tier 3 (90-95%) — CAUTION: Accelerating, watch for incentive spend
     - Tier 4 (<90%) — BEARISH: Significant residual erosion

5. **Present the brand ranking** with investment thesis per tier.

## Workflow: MSRP Parity Tracker (Pricing Power Signal)

Use this when a user asks "which new cars are selling over sticker" or "pricing power by OEM."

1. **Get current MSRP parity data** — Call `get_sold_summary` with `inventory_type=New`, `ranking_dimensions=make,model`, `ranking_measure=price_over_msrp_percentage`, `ranking_order=desc`, `date_from` (first of prior month), `date_to` (end of prior month), `top_n=30`.
   → **Extract only**: per make/model — price_over_msrp_percentage. Discard full response.

2. **Get prior period parity data** — Same call with dates shifted back 3 months.
   → **Extract only**: per make/model — price_over_msrp_percentage. Discard full response.

3. **Classify parity status with investment signals** — For each make/model:
   - **Above MSRP** — BULLISH: demand exceeds supply, pricing power intact, positive for OEM margins
   - **At MSRP** (±1%) — NEUTRAL: balanced market
   - **Below MSRP** — BEARISH: incentive-dependent, margin pressure, signals OEM may need to increase incentive spend
   - Map to ticker and aggregate by OEM

4. **Present the parity report** with ticker-level summaries.

## Output

Present: investment signal headline with ticker and direction, depreciation curve/trend data table with signals, ticker impact summary (OEM, lending/leasing, dealer group implications), and key BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL/CAUTION signals per finding.

## Important Notes

- **US-only:** All data requires US sold transaction data.
- Always map depreciation findings back to stock tickers. An analyst needs to know "Ford (F) trucks depreciating at X%/month" not just "F-150 prices are falling."
- For EV vs ICE comparisons, explicitly call out implications for TSLA, RIVN, LCID as well as legacy OEMs with growing EV portfolios.
- Depreciation acceleration is a LEADING indicator — it precedes incentive spend increases (margin pressure), production cuts (revenue impact), and residual restatements (balance sheet hit). Frame accordingly.
- If a model is transitioning from above-MSRP to below-MSRP, this is a key inflection point — flag it prominently with the affected ticker.
